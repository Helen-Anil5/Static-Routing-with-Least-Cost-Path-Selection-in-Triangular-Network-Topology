# Static Routing with Least-Cost Path Selection

## Overview
This repository contains a project implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates static routing, least-cost path selection, and centralized DHCP in a triangular router topology.

## Key Features
- Triangular network topology with three routers
- Static routes configured for least-cost path forwarding
- Centralized DHCP server serving multiple LANs
- End-to-end connectivity verified using ICMP ping

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Static Routing
- DHCP
- TCP/IP

## Result
Successful communication between end devices confirms correct routing and DHCP configuration without using dynamic routing protocols.
